### Decision Rationale

All 8 clinical criteria are met at 100%, and strong PubMed evidence supports blinatumomab
for pediatric MRD+ B-ALL. However, the NPI provided (`5467892394`) fails checksum validation
and is not found in the NPI Registry. Because provider identity verification is a mandatory
prerequisite per rubric guidelines, the request must be pended to obtain a valid NPI before
a final determination can be made.

## 4. [CLINICAL] Clinical Synopsis

### 4.1 Diagnoses

- **Primary:** Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)
- **Current Status:** Clinical remission (< 5% blast cells) but MRD-positive (0.1% leukemic cells via flow cytometry)

### 4.2 Key Findings

- Initial bone marrow biopsy (3/29/24): 85% lymphoblasts, confirming B-ALL diagnosis
- Cytogenetic analysis: Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-)
- Repeat bone marrow biopsy (10/4/24): < 5% blast cells, clinical remission achieved
- Flow cytometry (10/4/24): MRD-positive at 0.1% leukemic cells detected
- Bone marrow cellularity: Hypercellular (~90%)
- Patient weight: 30 kg, height: 117 cm
- Mild fatigue reported, otherwise well-appearing with stable vitals

### 4.3 Prior Treatments

| Phase                  | Duration                   | Agents                                                                  | Outcome                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Induction              | 4 weeks (4/1/24 – 4/29/24)| Vincristine, Dexamethasone, L-asparaginase, Daunorubicin               | Completed per protocol     |
| Consolidation          | 8 weeks (5/6/24 – 7/1/24) | HD Methotrexate, Mercaptopurine, Vincristine, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin | Completed per protocol |
| Maintenance (ongoing)  | Started 7/8/24             | Methotrexate, Mercaptopurine, Vincristine, IT Methotrexate (CNS prophylaxis) | MRD+ at post-consolidation |

### 4.4 Current Clinical Presentation

Patient presents as well-appearing with mild fatigue and decreased energy. No fevers, rashes,
bleeding, bruising, or other concerning symptoms. Physical exam shows no hepatosplenomegaly,
no lymphadenopathy, and normal neurological status. Vitals stable (HR 95, BP 110/70, RR 18,
Temp 98.7F). Laboratory values (CBC) within normal limits. Despite clinical remission with
< 5% blast cells, the presence of MRD at 0.1% is a high-risk marker for relapse in pediatric B-ALL.

## 5. [POLICY] Policy Analysis

### 5.1 Coverage Framework

Blinatumomab (Blincyto) is FDA-approved for the treatment of MRD-positive B-cell precursor
ALL in first or second complete remission with MRD >= 0.01%. This patient meets the
FDA-approved indication. No specific Medicare LCD/NCD was identified in the demo database for
blinatumomab; however, commercial plan criteria for Cigna typically require confirmed B-ALL
diagnosis, documented MRD-positive status, completion of prior standard therapy, and
Philadelphia chromosome status documentation.

*Overall confidence adjusted to 68% to account for known demo database limitations in
Code Validation and Coverage Policy components. Raw weighted score is 61.5%.

### 7.3 Rationale

The clinical case for blinatumomab is compelling. This 7-year-old male with Ph-negative B-ALL
has achieved complete remission but remains MRD-positive at 0.1% — a well-established high-risk
marker for relapse. He has completed standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy, and
blinatumomab is FDA-approved specifically for MRD+ B-ALL in first or second complete remission.
All 8 clinical criteria are met, and PubMed literature strongly supports this therapy with large
prospective studies showing 77% MRD conversion rates.

However, the submitted provider identifier (`5467892394`) fails NPI checksum validation and
cannot be verified against the NPI Registry. Per rubric guidelines, provider identity verification
is a mandatory gating criterion. The request must be pended until a valid NPI is provided.

### 7.4 Clinical Strength Assessment

- **Evidence Level:** Strong — supported by multiple prospective clinical trials
- **FDA Status:** Approved for this specific indication (MRD+ B-ALL, first/second CR)
- **Clinical Urgency:** Moderate — MRD positivity confers elevated relapse risk, but
  patient is clinically stable and in remission. Prompt but not emergent resolution appropriate.
- **Likelihood of Approval on Resubmission:** High — once valid NPI is provided, all
  criteria are expected to be met for approval.
