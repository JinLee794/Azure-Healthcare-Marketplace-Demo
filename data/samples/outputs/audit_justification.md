## 2. [STETHOSCOPE] MCP Connector Trail

Each validation step is recorded for audit traceability.

### 2.1 NPI Registry Lookup

- **Input:** NPI `5467892394`
- **Result:** [CLOSE] FAILED — Luhn checksum invalid
- **Follow-up:** Search for "Oncoso" in Illinois returned 0 results
- **Impact:** Provider cannot be verified — triggers PEND per rubric

### 2.2 ICD-10 Validation

- **Input:** `C91.00`, `C91.01`
- **Result:** [WARNING] NOT FOUND in local database
- **Context:** Demo database does not include oncology codes. Codes are valid per WHO ICD-10-CM.
- **Impact:** Non-blocking — documented as demo scope limitation

### 2.3 CMS Coverage Search

- **Input:** Blinatumomab, `J9039`
- **Result:** [WARNING] No LCD/NCD found
- **Follow-up:** Medical necessity check returned "unknown"
- **Context:** Demo database limited to select policies. Commercial plan (Cigna) criteria apply.
- **Impact:** Non-blocking — documented as demo scope limitation

### 2.4 PubMed Literature Search

- **Input:** "blinatumomab MRD positive pediatric B-ALL", category: therapy
- **Result:** [CHECK] 24 articles found
- **Key Citations:** PMIDs 38063317, 40827511, 40915860
- **Impact:** Strong evidence supports requested therapy

| 1 | Confirmed B-ALL diagnosis              | [CHECK] | Labs (pathology)  | BMBx 3/29/24, 85% blasts   |
| 2 | Ph chromosome status documented        | [CHECK] | Labs (pathology)  | Cytogenetics: Ph-negative   |
| 3 | Complete remission achieved            | [CHECK] | Labs (pathology)  | BMBx 10/4/24, < 5% blasts  |
| 4 | MRD-positive status confirmed          | [CHECK] | Labs (flow cyto)  | 0.1% leukemic cells        |
| 5 | Prior standard chemo completed         | [CHECK] | Doctor notes      | Induction + Consolidation   |
| 6 | FDA-approved indication                | [CHECK] | FDA label review  | MRD+ B-ALL, first CR        |
| 7 | Appropriate dosing/schedule            | [CHECK] | PA form           | 28 mcg/day x28d, >= 10 kg  |
| 8 | Appropriate treatment setting          | [CHECK] | PA form           | Infusion center then home   |

**Result:** 8/8 criteria met (100%)

## 5. [WARNING] Decision Justification

**Recommendation: PEND**

The case is pended due to a single critical gap: the provider identifier supplied on the
PA form (`5467892394`) cannot be verified as a valid NPI. Per the PA rubric, provider
identity verification is a mandatory gating criterion. A valid NPI must be obtained before
the case can proceed to final determination.

**If valid NPI is provided:**
- All 8 clinical criteria remain met
- Literature evidence strongly supports approval
- Expected outcome: APPROVE with HIGH confidence

**Gaps requiring follow-up:**

| # | Gap                                           | Severity  | Action                                   |
|---|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Invalid NPI (checksum failure)                | Critical  | Contact provider office for valid NPI    |
| 2 | ICD-10 not in local demo DB                   | Informational | No action — demo limitation          |
| 3 | No LCD/NCD in local demo DB                   | Informational | No action — demo limitation          |
