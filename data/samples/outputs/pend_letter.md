## 3. [WARNING] Information Needed

We have reviewed the submitted prior authorization request and clinical documentation
for the above-referenced member. To complete our review, we require the following
additional information:

### Item 1 — Valid National Provider Identifier (NPI)

**What is needed:** A valid 10-digit NPI number for the prescribing provider (Dr. Oncoso).

**Why it is needed:** The identifier submitted on the PA form (`5467892394`) does not
pass NPI checksum validation and could not be verified against the NPPES NPI Registry.
The PA form field is labeled "DEA, NPI or TIN" — the submitted value may be a Tax
Identification Number (TIN) or DEA number rather than an NPI. Provider identity verification
is required before a coverage determination can be issued.

**How to submit:** Please provide the provider's 10-digit NPI number using any of the
submission methods listed below. You can verify the correct NPI at
[NPPES NPI Registry](https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/).

## 4. Submission Instructions

Please submit the requested information by **2025-02-26** using one of the
following methods:

- **Fax:** (855) 840-1678
- **Online:** www.covermymeds.com/main/prior-authorization-forms/cigna/
- **Phone:** (800) 882-4462

If the requested information is not received by the deadline, this request may be
closed. A new prior authorization request may be submitted at any time with the
required information.

## 5. [INFO] Important Information

  the review is expected to proceed to final determination without additional holds.
- If you have questions about this request, please contact us at (800) 882-4462
  and reference `PA-003A-20251012`.
