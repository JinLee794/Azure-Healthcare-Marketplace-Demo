NUCLEAR MEDICINE REPORT

EXAMINATION: PET/CT Whole Body
DATE: 2024-12-01
PATIENT: Jane Doe
MRN: 1EG4-TE5-MK72
DOB: 03/15/1965

CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of suspicious pulmonary nodule found on
chest CT, history of smoking.

TECHNIQUE: Following a 6-hour fast, blood glucose measured at 95 mg/dL.
Patient received 12.5 mCi of F-18 FDG intravenously. Imaging was performed
60 minutes post-injection from skull base to mid-thigh using a GE Discovery
PET/CT scanner. Low-dose CT was performed for attenuation correction and
anatomic localization.

COMPARISON: CT Chest dated 11/20/2024

FINDINGS:

HEAD AND NECK:
- Normal physiologic brain uptake.
- No abnormal cervical lymphadenopathy.

CHEST:
- RIGHT LOWER LOBE NODULE: The 2.3 cm spiculated nodule in the posterior
  basal segment of the right lower lobe demonstrates INCREASED FDG UPTAKE
  with SUVmax of 4.2. This is SUSPICIOUS FOR MALIGNANCY.

- Mediastinal lymph nodes:
  - Subcarinal: No significant FDG uptake (SUVmax 1.8)
  - Right hilar: No significant FDG uptake (SUVmax 1.5)
  - Left hilar: No significant FDG uptake (SUVmax 1.4)

- No additional pulmonary nodules with abnormal FDG uptake.
- Cardiac uptake is within normal limits.

ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:
- Normal hepatic uptake. No focal hepatic lesions.
- Normal splenic uptake.
- Kidneys demonstrate normal excretion of radiotracer.
- No suspicious adrenal lesions.
- No pathologic mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
- Bladder activity is physiologic.
- No suspicious osseous lesions in the visualized skeleton.

MUSCULOSKELETAL:
- No abnormal skeletal uptake to suggest metastatic disease.
- Mild degenerative changes in the lumbar spine and right hip.

IMPRESSION:

1. HYPERMETABOLIC RIGHT LOWER LOBE PULMONARY NODULE (SUVmax 4.2)
   Findings are HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS FOR PRIMARY LUNG MALIGNANCY.

   The combination of:
   - Spiculated morphology
   - SUVmax > 2.5
   - Patient's smoking history

   Results in >90% probability of malignancy.

   RECOMMENDATION: Tissue diagnosis via CT-guided biopsy or
   bronchoscopic sampling.

2. No evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymph node involvement by PET
   criteria (no nodes with SUVmax > 2.5).

3. No evidence of distant metastatic disease.

4. If primary lung malignancy confirmed, clinical staging would be:
   cT1c N0 M0 (Stage IA3) based on current imaging.

FOLLOW-UP: Findings discussed with pulmonology (Dr. Martinez) on
12/01/2024. Patient to be scheduled for multidisciplinary tumor board.
