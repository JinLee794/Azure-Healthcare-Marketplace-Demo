CONSULTATION NOTE

DATE: 2024-12-05
PATIENT: Jane Doe
MRN: 1EG4-TE5-MK72
DOB: 03/15/1965
CONSULTING SERVICE: Pulmonology
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: Maria Martinez, MD

REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
Evaluation of suspicious pulmonary nodule for tissue diagnosis recommendation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Doe is a 58-year-old female referred for evaluation of a 2.3 cm right lower
lobe pulmonary nodule discovered incidentally on CT chest performed during
pre-operative workup for elective hip replacement surgery.

The patient denies any respiratory symptoms including cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis,
or chest pain. She reports no constitutional symptoms such as weight loss,
fatigue, or night sweats. She has not had any recent respiratory infections.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Osteoarthritis - right hip (scheduled for replacement)
2. Hypertension - well controlled on lisinopril
3. Hyperlipidemia - on atorvastatin
4. GERD - on omeprazole

SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Appendectomy (1985)
2. Cesarean section x2 (1990, 1993)

MEDICATIONS:
1. Lisinopril 10 mg daily
2. Atorvastatin 20 mg daily
3. Omeprazole 20 mg daily
4. Acetaminophen PRN for hip pain

ALLERGIES: NKDA

SOCIAL HISTORY:
- Tobacco: Former smoker, quit 5 years ago. 20 pack-year history (1 pack/day
  from age 18 to 53).
- Alcohol: Occasional wine with dinner, 1-2 glasses per week.
- Occupation: Retired school teacher.
- Lives with husband. Two adult children.

FAMILY HISTORY:
- Father: Lung cancer, diagnosed at age 72, deceased at 74
- Mother: Breast cancer, alive at 82
- No siblings

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Constitutional: No fever, chills, or weight loss
Respiratory: No cough, dyspnea, wheezing, or hemoptysis
Cardiovascular: No chest pain, palpitations, or edema
Gastrointestinal: Stable GERD symptoms
Musculoskeletal: Right hip pain (known osteoarthritis)

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vitals: BP 128/78, HR 72, RR 14, SpO2 98% on room air, Temp 98.2°F
General: Well-appearing female in no acute distress
HEENT: Normal
Neck: No lymphadenopathy, no JVD
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended
Extremities: No clubbing or cyanosis, mild decreased ROM right hip

DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES REVIEWED:

1. CT Chest (11/20/2024):
   - 2.3 cm spiculated nodule, right lower lobe
   - Lung-RADS 4B

2. PET/CT (12/01/2024):
   - SUVmax 4.2 in the right lower lobe nodule
   - No mediastinal lymphadenopathy
   - No distant metastases

PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS (12/03/2024):
- FEV1: 2.4 L (92% predicted)
- FVC: 3.1 L (96% predicted)
- FEV1/FVC: 77%
- DLCO: 85% predicted
Comment: Normal spirometry, no significant obstructive or restrictive disease.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

58-year-old former smoker with incidentally discovered 2.3 cm spiculated
pulmonary nodule demonstrating hypermetabolic activity on PET scan.

RISK ASSESSMENT:
Using the Brock model and incorporating PET data:
- Probability of malignancy: >90%
- Risk factors: Spiculated margins, PET positivity (SUV 4.2), smoking history,
  family history of lung cancer

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Primary lung malignancy (most likely - adenocarcinoma vs squamous cell)
2. Metastatic disease (less likely given no known primary)
3. Infectious/inflammatory (unlikely given PET characteristics)
4. Granulomatous disease (unlikely)

RECOMMENDATION:

Given the HIGH PROBABILITY OF MALIGNANCY, I recommend CT-GUIDED PERCUTANEOUS
LUNG BIOPSY for tissue diagnosis.

Rationale for percutaneous approach vs. bronchoscopy:
- Peripheral location in posterior basal segment
- Size and location accessible to CT guidance
- Higher diagnostic yield expected (>90% for peripheral lesions)

PROCEDURE RISKS DISCUSSED:
1. Pneumothorax (15-25%, most resolve without intervention)
2. Bleeding/hemoptysis (<5%)
3. Air embolism (rare)
4. Infection (rare)
5. Non-diagnostic sample requiring repeat procedure

Patient understands risks and benefits. She wishes to proceed with biopsy
before any further treatment planning.

Referral placed to Interventional Radiology (Dr. Sarah Chen) for CT-guided
percutaneous lung biopsy.

Case to be presented at thoracic multidisciplinary tumor board pending
pathology results.
