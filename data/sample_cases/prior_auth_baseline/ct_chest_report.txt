RADIOLOGY REPORT

EXAMINATION: CT Chest with Contrast
DATE: 2024-11-20
PATIENT: Jane Doe
MRN: 1EG4-TE5-MK72
DOB: 03/15/1965

CLINICAL INDICATION: Pre-operative evaluation for elective hip replacement

TECHNIQUE: Helical CT of the chest was performed from the thoracic inlet
through the adrenal glands following intravenous administration of 100 mL
of Omnipaque 350.

COMPARISON: None available.

FINDINGS:

LUNGS AND AIRWAYS:
- RIGHT LOWER LOBE: 2.3 x 1.9 cm spiculated pulmonary nodule located in the
  posterior basal segment. No internal calcification. Appears solid.
- No additional pulmonary nodules identified.
- Airways are patent to the subsegmental level.
- No bronchial wall thickening or mucous plugging.
- No evidence of air trapping.

PLEURA:
- No pleural effusion.
- No pleural thickening or calcification.

MEDIASTINUM AND HILA:
- Heart size is normal.
- No pericardial effusion.
- Mediastinal lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged.
  - Subcarinal: 8 mm (short axis)
  - Right hilar: 7 mm (short axis)
  - Left hilar: 6 mm (short axis)
- Main pulmonary artery is normal in caliber.
- Thoracic aorta is normal in caliber with mild atherosclerotic calcification.

CHEST WALL:
- No suspicious osseous lesions.
- Breast tissue appears symmetric.

UPPER ABDOMEN (limited evaluation):
- Liver, spleen, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.
- No suspicious renal lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. 2.3 cm spiculated solid pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe,
   SUSPICIOUS FOR MALIGNANCY. Given the patient's smoking history and
   morphologic features, this warrants further evaluation.

   RECOMMENDATION: PET-CT for metabolic characterization and staging
   evaluation. Consider tissue sampling if PET positive.

2. No evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.

3. Mild thoracic aortic atherosclerosis.

LUNG-RADS CATEGORY: 4B (>15% probability of malignancy)

FOLLOW-UP: Results and recommendations discussed with referring physician
