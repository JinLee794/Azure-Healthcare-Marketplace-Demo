# Subskill 2: Decision & Notification

## Purpose
Accept human review of assessment findings, confirm or override the AI recommendation, generate authorization documentation, and create notification letters.

## Prerequisites

**Required Files:**
- `waypoints/assessment.json` (from Subskill 1)

**Must verify:** Subskill 1 completed (assessment status is "assessment_complete")

---

## What This Subskill Does

1. Reads assessment from Subskill 1
2. Presents findings summary for human review
3. Accepts human decision (confirm, override, or request more info)
4. Generates authorization number (if approved)
5. Creates decision waypoint with audit trail
6. Generates notification letters

---

## Prompt Module Loading

Subskill 2 spans two beads:

| Bead | Prompt Module(s) | When to Read |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| `bd-pa-004-decision` | *(none — human review phase)* | N/A |
| `bd-pa-005-notify` | `references/prompts/05-output-formatting.md` | Before Step 6 |

### Context Scope for Subskill 2

**Read from waypoints only.** By this point, all clinical data, MCP results, policy evaluation, and determination have been captured in `waypoints/assessment.json`. Do not re-read raw clinical documents, MCP results, or prompt modules 01-04.

- **Bead 004**: Read `assessment.json` → `recommendation` section + human's decision input
- **Bead 005**: Read `decision.json` + `assessment.json` → `request.member`, `request.service`, `request.provider`, `criteria_evaluation`, `recommendation.gaps`

---

## Execution Flow

### Bead Tracking (Subskill 2)

Subskill 2 spans two beads. Update bead status as you progress:

| Bead | Steps | Checklist |
|------|-------|-----------|
| `bd-pa-004-decision` | 1-5 | [ ] Assessment loaded [ ] Summary presented [ ] Human decision captured [ ] Decision waypoint written [ ] Auth number generated (if approved) |
| `bd-pa-005-notify` | 6-7 | [ ] Notification letter generated [ ] Completion summary displayed |

**Before starting each bead group:** Mark the bead `in-progress` and update `waypoints/assessment.json` (and later `waypoints/decision.json`) under the `"beads"` key.
**After completing each bead group:** Mark the bead `completed` with a timestamp and persist.

### Step 1: Load Assessment

Read `waypoints/assessment.json` and verify:
- `status` is "assessment_complete"
- All required fields populated

**If assessment not found or incomplete:**
```
Error: Assessment not found or incomplete.
Please complete Subskill 1 (Intake & Assessment) first.
```
Exit.

---

### Step 2: Present Assessment Summary

> **Bead `bd-pa-004-decision`** — mark **in-progress** now.

### Step 3: Request Human Decision

```
⚠️ HUMAN DECISION REQUIRED
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Based on your review of the assessment above, please select:

  1. APPROVE - Confirm approval recommendation
  2. PEND - Request additional information
  3. DENY - Override to denial (requires justification)
  4. OVERRIDE - Override recommendation with different decision
  5. REQUEST MORE INFO - Need clarification before deciding

Enter choice (1-5):
```

**If user selects DENY or OVERRIDE:**
```
Please provide justification for this decision:
(This will be documented in the audit trail)

Justification:
```

**Decision normalization for waypoint output (`decision.outcome`):**
- User selects `APPROVE` → store `APPROVED`
- User selects `PEND` or `REQUEST MORE INFO` → store `PENDING`
- User selects `DENY` → store `DENIED`
- `OVERRIDE` must resolve to one of `APPROVED`, `PENDING`, or `DENIED`

---

### Step 4: Create Decision Waypoint

**File:** `waypoints/decision.json`

Include bead state in the decision waypoint:

```json
{
  "request_id": "...",
  "decision_date": "ISO datetime",

  "beads": [
    {"id": "bd-pa-001-intake",    "status": "completed", "completed_at": "..."},
    {"id": "bd-pa-002-clinical",   "status": "completed", "completed_at": "..."},
    {"id": "bd-pa-003-recommend",  "status": "completed", "completed_at": "..."},
    {"id": "bd-pa-004-decision",   "status": "completed", "completed_at": "..."},
    {"id": "bd-pa-005-notify",     "status": "not-started"}
  ],

  "decision": {
    "outcome": "APPROVED/DENIED/PENDING",
    "auth_number": "PA-YYYYMMDD-XXXXX" or null,
    "valid_from": "YYYY-MM-DD" or null,
    "valid_through": "YYYY-MM-DD" or null,
    "limitations": [...] or null,
    "override_applied": true/false
  },

  "rationale": {
    "summary": "...",
    "supporting_facts": ["...", "..."],
    "policy_basis": "..."
  },

  "audit": {
    "reviewed_by": "AI-Assisted Review",
    "review_date": "...",
    "turnaround_hours": float,
    "confidence": "HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW",
    "auto_approved": true/false
  },

  "override_details": {
    "original_recommendation": "APPROVE/PEND",
    "final_decision": "...",
    "override_reason": "...",
    "overriding_authority": "..."
  } or null
}
```

---

### Step 5: Generate Authorization Number

If decision is APPROVED:

```
Authorization Number: PA-[YYYYMMDD]-[5-digit random]
Valid From: [Service Date or Today]
Valid Through: [Service Date + 30 days default]
```

---

### Step 6: Generate Notification Letters

> **Bead `bd-pa-004-decision`** — mark **completed** after Step 5 finishes.
> **Bead `bd-pa-005-notify`** — mark **in-progress** now.

#### Context Checkpoint 4
Write `waypoints/decision.json`. For output generation, carry forward only compact assessment data needed for notification and determination formatting (`request.member`, `request.service`, `request.provider`, `criteria_evaluation`, `recommendation.gaps`).

**Read now:** `references/prompts/05-output-formatting.md`

Based on decision outcome, generate appropriate letter:

First, generate structured determination JSON output:
- `outputs/determination.json` (per `references/prompts/05-output-formatting.md`)

**For APPROVED:**
Create `outputs/approval_letter.md`:

```markdown

## Notes for Claude/Copilot

1. **Always present full assessment:** Don't summarize too much - human needs all details
2. **Require explicit decision:** Don't proceed without clear human input
3. **Document everything:** All decisions and overrides go in the audit trail
4. **Generate complete letters:** Letters should be ready to send
5. **Calculate turnaround:** Track time from request to decision
6. **Respect human judgment:** If human overrides, document but don't challenge
