# Prior Authorization Decision Rubric

## Purpose
This document defines the decision rules and criteria evaluation logic for the Prior Authorization Review Skill. Claude/Copilot MUST read this file before making any recommendations.

## Decision Logic

### Decision Types

| Decision | When to Use | AI Can Recommend? |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **APPROVE** | All criteria met, high confidence | ✅ Yes |
| **PEND** | Missing info, low confidence, or borderline | ✅ Yes |
| **DENY** | Criteria clearly not met | ❌ No (human only) |

### Important: AI Never Recommends DENY

In default mode, the AI will **NEVER** recommend DENY. This is intentional:
- Denial decisions have significant impact on patient care
- Denial requires explicit human clinical judgment
- AI can identify reasons for potential denial but defers to human

If criteria are clearly not met, AI recommends PEND with explanation.

---

## Approval Criteria (ALL must be true)

### 1. Provider Verification (Required)
```
✅ PASS: NPI found AND active AND specialty appropriate
❌ FAIL: NPI not found OR inactive OR specialty mismatch
```

**If FAIL:** Recommend PEND, request credentialing documentation

### 2. Code Validation (Required)
```
✅ PASS: All ICD-10 AND CPT/HCPCS codes valid
❌ FAIL: Any code invalid or unrecognized
```

**If FAIL:** Recommend PEND, request code clarification

### 3. Coverage Policy (Required)
```
✅ PASS: Applicable LCD/NCD found for service
❌ FAIL: No applicable policy found
```

**If FAIL:** Recommend PEND for medical director review

### 4. Clinical Criteria (≥80% Required)
```
✅ PASS: ≥80% of policy criteria marked MET
⚠️ BORDERLINE: 60-79% of criteria MET
❌ FAIL: <60% of criteria MET
```

**If BORDERLINE:** Recommend PEND for additional documentation
**If FAIL:** Recommend PEND with specific gaps

### 5. Confidence Threshold (Required)
```
✅ HIGH: ≥80% overall confidence → Can recommend APPROVE
⚠️ MEDIUM: 60-79% confidence → Can recommend APPROVE with flags
❌ LOW: <60% confidence → Must recommend PEND
```

## Evaluation Order

Evaluate in this order (stop at first failure):

1. **Provider Verification**
   - Check NPI status
   - If not verified → PEND (request credentialing)

2. **Code Validation**
   - Validate all ICD-10 codes
   - Validate all CPT/HCPCS codes
   - If any invalid → PEND (request clarification)

3. **Coverage Policy**
   - Search for applicable LCD/NCD
   - If none found → PEND (medical director review)

4. **Clinical Criteria**
   - Evaluate each policy criterion
   - Calculate percentage MET
   - If <60% → PEND (significant gaps)
   - If 60-79% → PEND (borderline, request additional docs)
   - If ≥80% → Continue to confidence check

5. **Confidence Assessment**
   - Calculate overall confidence
   - If <60% → PEND (low confidence)
   - If ≥60% → Can proceed to APPROVE

## Criteria Evaluation Rules

### Status Definitions

| Status | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **MET** | Clear evidence in documentation supports criterion |
| **NOT_MET** | Documentation clearly contradicts criterion |
| **INSUFFICIENT** | Unable to determine from available documentation |

### Evidence Requirements

- **MET** requires specific, quotable evidence from documentation
- **NOT_MET** requires contradicting evidence or explicit absence
- **INSUFFICIENT** means evidence was looked for but not found

### Confidence Scoring

For each criterion, assign confidence (0-100):
- 90-100: Direct, unambiguous evidence
- 70-89: Strong inference from evidence
- 50-69: Reasonable inference with some uncertainty
- <50: Significant uncertainty

## Override Rules

### Human Can Override To:

| From AI | To Human | Requirements |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| APPROVE | PEND | Justification required |
| APPROVE | DENY | Justification + clinical basis required |
| PEND | APPROVE | Review completed, gaps resolved |
| PEND | DENY | Justification + clinical basis required |

### Override Documentation

All overrides must include:
1. Original AI recommendation
2. Final human decision
3. Justification for override
4. Name/role of overriding authority

---

## Special Cases

### Demo Mode
When using sample files with demo NPI (1234567890):
- Skip NPI MCP lookup for demo provider only
- All other MCP calls execute normally
- Proceed with validation as if NPI verified

### Urgent Requests
For services marked urgent:
- Expedite review (target <24 hours)
- Apply same criteria
- Flag for priority processing

### Retrospective Reviews
For services already rendered:
- Apply same criteria
- Note that service already occurred
- Decision affects payment, not service delivery

## Confidence Calculation

Overall confidence = weighted average:
- Provider verification: 20%
- Code validation: 15%
- Coverage policy match: 20%
- Clinical criteria: 35%
- Documentation quality: 10%

Formula:
```
Overall = (0.20 × Provider) + (0.15 × Codes) + (0.20 × Policy) + (0.35 × Clinical) + (0.10 × DocQuality)
```
