# Step 4: Clinical Protocol Operations and Statistics

## Purpose

Generate the operational and statistical sections (9-12) of the clinical protocol, including study assessments, adverse event reporting, statistical analysis plan, and supporting documentation.

## Prerequisites

**Required Files:**
- `waypoints/intervention_metadata.json`
- `waypoints/01_clinical_research_summary.json`
- `waypoints/02_protocol_foundation.md`
- `waypoints/02_protocol_metadata.json` (must show step_3_status: "completed")
- `waypoints/03_protocol_intervention.md`

---

## What This Subskill Does

1. Verifies Step 3 completion
2. **Performs sample size calculation** (asks user for parameters, runs calculator script)
3. Reads protocol template and shared guidance
4. Synthesizes operational and statistical content for Sections 9-12
5. Creates new file `waypoints/04_protocol_operations.md` with Sections 9-12
6. Updates protocol and intervention metadata

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites

Read `waypoints/02_protocol_metadata.json` and verify:
- `step_3_status` is "completed"
- All section files exist

**If Step 3 not completed:**
```
Error: Step 3 must be completed before generating operations sections.
Step 3 status: [current status]

Please complete Step 3 to generate intervention details (Sections 7-8).
```
Exit.

---

### Step 2: Sample Size Calculation (Interactive)

**Prompt user for sample size parameters:**

```
📊 Sample Size Calculation

To calculate the required sample size, I need some information:

1. Endpoint Type:
   a) Continuous (e.g., change in blood pressure, score improvement)
   b) Binary (e.g., response rate, success/failure)

Enter choice (a or b):
```

**For Continuous Endpoints:**
```
2. Expected Effect Size (mean difference between groups):
3. Expected Standard Deviation:
4. Alpha (Type I error rate, default 0.05):
5. Power (default 0.80):
6. Expected Dropout Rate (default 0.15):
```

**For Binary Endpoints:**
```
2. Expected proportion in control group (p1):
3. Expected proportion in treatment group (p2):
4. Alpha (Type I error rate, default 0.05):
5. Power (default 0.80):
6. Expected Dropout Rate (default 0.15):
```

**Run the calculator:**
```bash
python scripts/sample_size_calculator.py \
  --endpoint-type continuous \
  --effect-size [user input] \
  --std-dev [user input] \
  --alpha 0.05 \
  --power 0.80 \
  --dropout 0.15 \
  --output waypoints/02_sample_size_calculation.json
```

**If Python not available:**
```
Note: Python sample size calculator not available.
Using statistical formulas for estimation.

Estimated sample size based on research findings:
[Provide estimate from similar trials in research summary]

⚠️ Recommend verification by biostatistician.
```

### Step 3: Generate Section 9 (Assessments)

Generate comprehensive assessment section:

**9.1 Efficacy Assessments:**
- List all efficacy assessments aligned with endpoints
- Specify timing and method of each assessment
- Include validated instruments/scales if applicable

**9.2 Safety Assessments:**
- Vital signs schedule
- Physical examinations
- ECG monitoring (if applicable)
- Imaging (if applicable)

**9.3 Adverse Events (CRITICAL - Include ALL 9 Subsections):**
- Complete AE/SAE definitions per ICH E2A
- CTCAE grading scale reference
- Causality assessment criteria
- Reporting timelines (24 hours for SAEs)
- Follow-up requirements

**9.4 Laboratory Assessments:**
- Required lab panels
- Testing frequency
- Central vs local lab considerations

**9.5 Schedule of Assessments:**
- Create comprehensive assessment schedule table
- Visits: Screening, Baseline, Treatment, Follow-up
- Windows for each visit

### Step 4: Generate Section 10 (Statistics)

Use sample size calculation results:

- Show formula used
- State N per arm and total N (adjusted for dropout)

**10.3 Analysis Populations:**

---

### Step 5: Generate Section 11 (Operations)

**11.1 Regulatory/Ethical:**
- Applicable regulations (21 CFR, ICH)
- Ethics committee requirements
- Protocol amendments process

**11.2 Informed Consent:**
- ICF requirements
- Re-consent triggers
- Assent for minors (if applicable)

**11.3 Data Handling:**
- EDC system requirements
- Source documentation
- Data retention period (typically 15 years)

**11.4 Quality Assurance:**
- Monitoring approach
- Audit provisions
- Inspection readiness

**11.5 Site Closure:**

### Step 6: Generate Section 12 (References)

Compile references organized by category:

- Disease/indication literature
- Intervention literature
- Statistical methods
- Assessment instruments

Include 30-60 references typical for a comprehensive protocol.

---

### Step 7: Create Operations File

**File:** `waypoints/04_protocol_operations.md`

Write Sections 9-12 to markdown file.

---

### Step 8: Update Protocol Metadata

Update `waypoints/02_protocol_metadata.json`:
- Set `step_4_status` to "completed"
- Add sections 9, 10, 11, 12 to `sections_completed` array
- Update `protocol_status` to "sections_complete"
- Add `waypoint_files` object tracking all protocol section files
- Update notes

---

### Step 9: Update Intervention Metadata

Update `waypoints/intervention_metadata.json`:
- Add "04-protocol-operations" to `completed_steps` array
- Set `protocol_status` to "sections_complete"

---

### Step 10: Display Summary

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing Step 4:
- [ ] Sample size calculation completed (or fallback with disclaimer)
- [ ] Section 9 generated with ALL 9 AE/SAE subsections
- [ ] Section 10 generated with statistical analysis plan
- [ ] Sample size section uses actual calculated values
- [ ] Section 11 includes all operational subsections
- [ ] Section 12 includes 30-60 references organized by category
- [ ] Protocol metadata updated correctly
- [ ] Intervention metadata updated correctly

## Notes for Claude/Copilot

- **Sample size calculation is interactive** - requires user input
- **Output stays within token limits** by focusing on Sections 9-12 only
- **AE/SAE section is critical** - must include all regulatory requirements
- **Statistical section must be specific** - use actual calculation parameters
- **References should be real** - cite actual FDA guidances and literature
