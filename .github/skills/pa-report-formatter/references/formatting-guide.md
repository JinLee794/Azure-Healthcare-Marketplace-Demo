[====================] 100% HIGH
```

**Rules:**
- Bar width: exactly 20 characters
- Filled character: `=`
- Unfilled character: `-`
- Calculate filled count: `round(score / 5)`
- Append percentage and level label
- Level thresholds: LOW < 60%, MEDIUM 60–79%, HIGH >= 80%

### Weighted Confidence Table Format

```
| Component              | Weight | Score | Weighted | Bar                         |
|------------------------|--------|-------|----------|-----------------------------|

## 7. Prohibited Patterns

| Prohibited | Use Instead |
|------------|-------------|
| Unicode emoji (🔍, ✅, ❌, ⚠️, 📋, etc.) | Material icon tokens (`[CHECK]`, `[CLOSE]`, etc.) |
| Emoji in headers | Icon tokens or plain text |
| Colored text / HTML | Standard Markdown only |
| Placeholder text (`{{FIELD}}`, `[TBD]`) | Actual data or "Not available" |
| Unexplained abbreviations | Define on first use |
| Inline footnotes | Use subsection or parenthetical |
| More than one `# H1` per document | Single H1, use `## H2` for sections |

---

## 8. Tone and Voice

- **Professional:** Formal but accessible. Suitable for clinical and administrative audiences.
- **Objective:** Present facts and evidence without advocacy. Let the data speak.
- **Precise:** Use specific values, dates, and references. Avoid vague qualifiers ("somewhat," "fairly").
- **Transparent:** Clearly label what is AI-generated vs. source data. Flag uncertainty explicitly.
- **Empathetic in correspondence:** Notification letters should be respectful of the patient's situation while maintaining professional clarity.

## 9. Footer Template

Every document ends with:

```markdown
---

*[DOCUMENT] Generated: YYYY-MM-DD | Request ID: PA-XXXXXXXX | Skill: pa-report-formatter v1.0*
