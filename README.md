# Healthcare Agent Accelerator for Azure

**Secure, production-patterned AI agents for healthcare workflows — built on Azure infrastructure and the Model Context Protocol (MCP).**

---

## The Problem

Prior Authorization (PA) is one of healthcare’s most broken processes. It sits at the intersection of providers, payors, and patients — and it fails all three.

### By the Numbers

| Stakeholder | Pain Point | Impact |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **Providers** | 41 PA requests/week per physician, ~13 hours of staff time | 88% report high/extreme administrative burden |
| **Payors** | 75% of PA tasks remain manual, ~$3.14 per transaction | Up to 75% inaccuracy in manual approval decisions |
| **Patients** | 93% of physicians say PA delays necessary care | 82% treatment abandonment; cancer delays increase mortality 1.2–3.2% |

### Regulatory Pressure Is Accelerating

**CMS 2026 regulations** now mandate:

- **Real-time data exchange** via HL7 FHIR APIs — 72 hours for urgent, 7 days for standard PA decisions
- **Transparent decision rationale** — payors must provide detailed explanations for every PA outcome
- **FHIR-driven interoperability** across all participating systems

Healthcare organizations need to modernize — but building AI agents that handle clinical data requires more than prompt engineering. It requires **secure infrastructure, compliance-ready patterns, and interoperable tooling**.

---

## What This Project Does

This accelerator demonstrates how to build **healthcare AI agents on Azure** using established, secure patterns — not prototypes stitched together with API keys and hope.

It provides:

1. **Consolidated MCP Servers** — Four domain-grouped Azure Function servers exposing 39 healthcare tools (NPI, ICD-10, CMS, FHIR, PubMed, Clinical Trials, Cosmos DB RAG, document reading) via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs)
2. **Agent Workflows** — Multi-step orchestration for prior authorization, clinical trial matching, literature search, and patient data — with audit trails and human-in-the-loop checkpoints
3. **Skills & Prompt Engineering Layer** — Six domain skills with phase-aligned prompt modules, lazy context loading, bead-based progress tracking, and rubric-driven decision logic
4. **Azure-Native Security** — APIM gateway with OAuth 2.0 / Entra ID, managed identity throughout, Private Link, HIPAA-ready Bicep infrastructure
5. **Multiple Agent Surfaces** — Works with GitHub Copilot, Azure AI Foundry Agents, and custom orchestration UIs (Gradio + CLI)

### What Makes This Different

| Concern | Typical AI Demo | This Accelerator |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| **Authentication** | Hardcoded API keys | Entra ID + managed identity + APIM gateway |
| **Data access** | Mock responses | Live FHIR, NPI, CMS, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov APIs |
| **Compliance** | Hand-waved | Private Link, audit logging, HIPAA-tagged infrastructure |
| **Tooling protocol** | Bespoke function calling | Model Context Protocol (MCP) — open, portable, model-agnostic |
| **Prompt engineering** | Monolithic system prompt | Phase-aligned prompt modules with lazy loading and context checkpoints |
| **Deployment** | localhost only | `azd up` → full Azure deployment with APIM, Functions, AHDS |
| **Auditability** | None | Waypoint-based audit trail with bead tracking per workflow step |

---

## Business Value

### For Healthcare IT Teams

- **40% reduction** in PA processing costs through AI-enabled auto-assessment of low-risk cases
- **Days → Hours** turnaround on PA decisions, aligning with CMS 2026 mandates
- **75% fewer** manual errors by grounding decisions in real-time clinical data (NPI, ICD-10, CMS policy)
- **One architecture** supporting GitHub Copilot, Azure AI Foundry, and custom agent surfaces

### For Platform & Security Teams

- **Zero secrets in code** — managed identity from MCP server to FHIR endpoint
- **APIM as the single front door** — rate limiting, JWT validation, audit logging, IP filtering
- **Infrastructure as Code** — fully deployable via `azd up` with Bicep modules
- **HIPAA-ready** — Private Link, encryption at rest, diagnostic logging, BAA-eligible services

### For Developers

- **Open protocol** — MCP servers work with any MCP-compatible client, not locked to one vendor
- **Local-first development** — run all four servers locally with `make local-start`
- **Evals built in** — contract validation, latency benchmarks, and native framework evaluation out of the box

## Skills & Prompt Engineering

The project uses a **skills layer** that injects domain knowledge, structured prompt modules, and decision rubrics into AI agent context. Skills are designed for composability — each can be used independently in GitHub Copilot, Azure AI Foundry, or custom agents.

### Skills Catalog

| Skill | Description | MCP Servers Used |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **prior-auth-azure** | End-to-end PA review with two-subskill workflow, 5 prompt modules, rubric | mcp-reference-data, mcp-clinical-research, cosmos-rag |
| **pa-report-formatter** | Formats assessment/decision data into professional reports with Material Design iconography | None (formatting only) |
| **clinical-trial-protocol** | Multi-phase clinical trial protocol generation with literature-backed evidence | mcp-clinical-research |
| **document-reader** | Load local documents (PDFs, images, JSON/CSV) for agent consumption | document-reader |
| **azure-fhir-developer** | FHIR R4 development patterns with Azure-specific auth and coding systems | mcp-clinical-research |
| **azure-health-data-services** | DICOM imaging, MedTech device data, and FHIR integration on Azure | mcp-clinical-research |

### Prompt Engineering Architecture

Unlike monolithic system prompts, this project uses a **phase-aligned, lazy-loaded prompt architecture** that manages context windows efficiently and ensures consistent, auditable decision-making.

        CP4["Checkpoint 4<br/>Human decision → final record"]
    end

```

#### Key Design Principles

1. **Lazy module loading** — Prompt modules load only when their workflow phase (bead) starts. Each bead defines which modules to read and which to ignore, keeping context usage minimal.

2. **Context checkpoints** — Waypoint files compress raw data (MCP results, clinical docs, policy text) into structured JSON summaries. Downstream phases read the waypoint, not the raw inputs, preventing context overflow.

3. **Rubric-driven decisions** — Decision logic is externalized into `rubric.md` files. The AI reads the rubric at decision time rather than relying on training data, making criteria transparent, versioned, and auditable.

4. **Bead tracking** — Each workflow phase is tracked as a "bead" with `not-started → in-progress → completed` lifecycle. Bead state persists in waypoint files for resume-from-checkpoint capability.

5. **Context scope rules** — Each bead explicitly defines what data to read and what to ignore, preventing context pollution from upstream phases.

## Agent Workflows

### Prior Authorization Review

The flagship workflow demonstrates end-to-end PA processing using four specialized agents with concurrent execution and structured audit trails:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["PA Request"] --> B["Compliance Gate<br/>(NPI + ICD-10 +<br/>RAG Policy Retrieval)"]
    B --> C["Clinical Review +<br/>Coverage Analysis<br/>(concurrent agents)"]
    C --> D["Synthesis Agent →<br/>Recommendation"]
    D --> E["Human Decision<br/>(Approve / Pend / Deny)"]
    E --> F["Notification<br/>Letters"]
```

**Agents:** Compliance Agent (NPI + ICD-10 validation) → Clinical Reviewer (FHIR + PubMed + Trials) + Coverage Agent (CMS + RAG policies) run concurrently → Synthesis Agent (rubric-driven recommendation). Each phase produces auditable waypoint artifacts. The workflow supports resume-from-checkpoint via bead tracking if interrupted.

### Also Included

- **Clinical Trial Matching** — Multi-phase protocol generation with FHIR patient data, PubMed evidence, and ClinicalTrials.gov integration
- **Literature Search** — PubMed-powered research workflows with clinical query filters
- **Patient Data** — FHIR-based patient data retrieval and clinical summarization

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+, Azure Functions Core Tools v4
- Azure subscription (for cloud deployment)
- GitHub Copilot (for VS Code agent surface)

### Run Locally

```bash
# Start all four MCP servers (ports 7071, 7072, 7073, 7078)
make local-start

# If you deployed with azd, sync local runtime endpoints from azd outputs
make sync-local-env

# Smoke test
curl http://localhost:7071/.well-known/mcp | jq

# Run the prior-auth workflow with sample data
cd src && source agents/.venv/bin/activate
python -m agents --workflow prior-auth --demo --local

# Seed sample payer policies into cosmos-rag (auto-syncs env + starts cosmos-rag)
make seed-data
```

### Deploy to Azure

```bash
azd up
```

This provisions APIM, Azure Functions, Azure Health Data Services, and all supporting infrastructure via Bicep.

### Use in VS Code with Copilot

Configure MCP servers in `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "servers": {
    "healthcare-reference-data":    { "type": "http", "url": "http://localhost:7071/mcp" },
    "healthcare-clinical-research": { "type": "http", "url": "http://localhost:7072/mcp" },
    "healthcare-cosmos-rag":        { "type": "http", "url": "http://localhost:7073/mcp" },
    "healthcare-document-reader":   { "type": "http", "url": "http://localhost:7078/mcp" }
  }
}
```

Then ask in Copilot Chat:

```
Does CPT 27447 require prior auth? Validate the provider NPI and check CMS coverage.
```
